# django-todo

A basic interface that simulates a TodoList experience, using Python and Django.
The goal is to have a login/logout/register system that shows content only to those who are authenticated,
and to have also task management options : completed, date, name, details, categories maybe ...

This is my first step into backend stuff.

Here is a screenshot of the main page, it's not done yet

# django-todo

A basic interface that simulate a TodoList experience, using Python and Django.
This is my first step into backend stuff.

The goal is to have a login/logout/register system that shows content only to those who are authenticated,
and to have also task management options : completed ? date, name, details, ... 

Make the website responsive with a solid design pattern.
